    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      I’m a passionate and curious creator with a deep interest in technology,
      design, and innovation. I enjoy exploring how digital systems and physical
      hardware connect — from coding software to building devices that bring
      ideas to life. My journey began with a fascination for problem-solving and
      has grown into a drive to understand how things work and how they can be
      improved. I believe in learning by doing, collaborating with others, and
      staying adaptable in a fast-changing world of technology. I’m motivated by
      challenges that blend creativity with logic, and I love working on
      projects that have a real-world impact. Whether it’s designing an embedded
      system, developing code, or experimenting with new tools, I’m always eager
      to expand my skills and push my limits.
