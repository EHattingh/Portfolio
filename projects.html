  <!-- Project 1: LMS System -->
  <h3>1.LMS System</h3>
  <p>
    This learning management system (LMS) was developed during my free time as
    a personal project to deepen my understanding of database design and
    management. I wanted to explore how databases interact with web
    applications and how to structure them efficiently for scalability and
    performance. Through building this system, I gained hands-on experience
    with creating relational database schemas, managing data integrity, and
    implementing features that reflect real-world use cases such as user
    authentication, course management, and data tracking. The project served
    as both a practical exercise and a learning journey into the fundamentals
    of backend development and database architecture.
